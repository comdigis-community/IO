#### Getting Started

Thank you for your interest in our platform. We appreciate your curiosity and are delighted that you are exploring I/O as part of your audio development workflow.

At this stage, the distributed binary package in the form of an **xcframework** provides support exclusively for **iOS and macOS** platforms. We are actively working on expanding compatibility to include **Android**, with support for **Linux** and **Windows** planned for future releases.

The project includes two sample applications demonstrating key use cases: 

An **iOS sample** showcasing integration with *RealityKit*, illustrating how to drive spatial audio experience in interactive environments. 

 A **macOS sample** offering a configurable application where parameters can be adjusted to explore and experiment with the engine’s capabilities.

We invite you, as an audio developer, to explore the extended documentation available in the root of the repository under the **/documentation** directory. There you will find detailed technical guides, installation instructions, examples, and patterns to accelerate your adoption.

For further technical information, comprehensive guides, didactic resources, and the full API reference, please visit our official documentation site at https://docs.comdigis.com/ where content is continually updated and expanded to support your work.
