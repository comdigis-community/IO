#### Maintainers

Maintainers have the highest level of access to the project’s GitHub repository. They are responsible for all project decisions and for enforcing the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The following table provides contact information and availability for the project maintainers:

| Responsible      | GitHub user     |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| XYZ | @comdigis-xyz |

The ***maintainers*** primarily handle requests through *GitHub Issues* or *Discussions*, aiming to respond to *issues* within approximately 2 to 5 business days, and to *pull requests* within 1 to 3 business days. For urgent matters, direct contact via GitHub is recommended. If a maintainer is unavailable, critical decisions may be postponed or delegated to a contributor, always using the repository’s official channels. New maintainers may be added after demonstrating a strong track record of quality contributions and reviews.
